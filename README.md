# Airplanes-Data-Analysis

# Introduction
This project is an exploratory data analysis (EDA) of German air fares. The objective is to clean, process, and visualize the data to gain insights into air fare trends and patterns. The analysis is performed using Python and popular data science libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and NetworkX.

# Dataset
The dataset used in this project is a CSV file containing information about air fares, including the scrape date, departure date, route, and price.

# Project Structure
The project is structured as follows:

1. Importing Libraries: Import necessary libraries for data manipulation, date handling, and visualization.
2. Loading Data: Load the dataset and display basic information such as the first few rows, last few rows, shape, and data types.
3. Data Cleaning:
Convert date columns to datetime objects.
Convert price column to float after removing commas.
Check and handle missing values.
4. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
Analyze and visualize the distribution of air fares.
Explore the relationship between air fares and departure dates.
Investigate the distribution of air fares across different routes.
Use NetworkX to visualize routes as a network.
5. Insights and Conclusions: Summarize key findings from the analysis.
